# School_District_Analysis
Jupyter and Pandas Directory

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to evaluate the math and reading test performance of high school students from 15 schools. An updated analysis, found below, had to be performed due to the discovery of academic dishonesty at by 9th graders at Thomas High School.

## Results and Code

### District Summary

The upated analysis resulted in a decrease in the average math score and % passing math score. Despite the average reading score not being affected, the % passing reading score decreased. Overall, the overall passing percentage decreased by a tenth.

### School Summary

As this incident occured at Thomas High School, only their school summary was affected. The average math score increase by about a hundreth and the average reading score decrease by about a hundreth. However, the percent passing for math and reading scores and the overall passing percentage all rose by nearly 40%.

### Thomas High School Performance compared to other schools

With the 9th graders disqualified, Thomas High School went from a 65% overall passing to a 90% overall passing, now ranking them in the top 5 schools

### Replacement of 9th graders on scores by grade, school spending, school size and school type
Due to incorrectly attempting to make a copy of the original analysis, I am unable to provide comparisons of the original analysis to the updated analysis. However, it can be assumed that by removing the dishonest values, as the overall % passing rose significantly, it would have skewed the data for this medium sized, $630-644 spending range, charter school. However, for the calculations conducted per grade, the results would have been unaffected as the values were divided by per grade count.

## Summary

Four changes that were observed by replacing the 9th grade values from Thomas High School with NaNs were district percent passing math scores, district percent passing reading scores and overall district passing scores. In addition, Thomas High School rank rose to the top 5, where it was not previously.
